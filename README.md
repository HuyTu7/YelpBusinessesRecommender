The json has been converted into csv files using the sample code provided by the Yelp at https://github.com/Yelp/dataset-examples

The converted CSV can't be loaded into Github due to large size.

### Files:
|\_ Work: where all code resides. \\
|\_ Documents: All the documents provided by the professor. \\
|\_ Sample Data: The filtered data files and sample initial files. \\

Code Folder Details:
- The ReadData\_AG.py is used for reading csv files, merging data, reducing dimensionality of data and data modification like modifying the rating. After completing data pre-processing, the final dataframe is stored in file to avoid processing the code again and again. Take a look at the path folder of data file.
