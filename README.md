The json has been converted into csv files using the sample code provided by the Yelp at https://github.com/Yelp/dataset-examples

The converted CSV can't be loaded into Github due to large size.

Currently, the repository contains three folders namely:
- Work: where all code resides.
- Documents: All the documents provided by the professor.
- Sample Data: The filtered data files and sample initial files. 

Code Folder Details:
- The ReadData\_AG.py is used for reading csv files, merging data, reducing dimensionality of data and data modification like modifying the rating. After completing data pre-processing, the final dataframe is stored in file to avoid processing the code again and again. Take a look at the path folder of data file.
